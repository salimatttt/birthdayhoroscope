# logic explanation:
    Welcome and Hello to everyone seeing this Github page :)
    This GitHub page consist of two individuals who are undergraduate students. 
    To whoever reading this, we are in Version Control Skills Lab 12 located on Canvas.
    One of the students is a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. 
    The other individual is majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Studio Arts.
    We created a program that took a users name and birthday information. 
    Using that info, my partner and I were able to compare the info given  to a tree of possible horscopes.
    We clearly printed out the users name, birthday, horoscope, and bit of info about whatever zodiac that the 
    user inputed. 
    The link under each horscopes allows people to gain more information about their horoscope.
    I hope you enjoyed this programming that my partner & I wrote. I hope it was very beneficial to everyone :)
    Thank you for taking the time to look at our program.
    Have a nice day and well wishes to you <3.
